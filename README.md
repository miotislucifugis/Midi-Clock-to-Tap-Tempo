# Midi-Clock-to-Tap-Tempo
Midi-sync virtually any device that has tap tempo button or footswitch
This layout is for the 5v Arduino ProMicro, 6n138 for the midi in circuit (midi in DIN jack or 3.5 trs to TP8)   and 4n33 (!need to double check) to provide isolated control over the pedal's tap tempo button pins.  (TP10 -2 pin header wired to tap tempo button)
The 3 pin header, TP9,is power: GND, VCC(5v), RAW (9v or less! ).  For most uses, connect GND and RAW to the pedal's 9v DC jack.
